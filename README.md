# Project 1: Chest X-ray Pneumonia Classifier

Developed a deep learning neural network (DLNN) that classifies Chest X-Rays images within normal and pneumonia categories to help medical diagnosis in time and assertiveness.
Developed a FLASK API to serve as the interface with users.

In order to reach the best result, the DLNN used a ResNet18 backbone and was trained using the [kaggle Chest X-Ray pneumonia dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia). The figures below show the results of the confusion matrix and a batch of the test dataset used to train the network.
