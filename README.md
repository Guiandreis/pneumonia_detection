# Project 1: Chest x-Ray Pneumonia Classifier

- Created a deep learning neural network that classifier Chest X-Rays images within normal an pneumonia categories to help medical diagnosis in time and assertieness.
- Developed a FLASK API to serve as interface with users.

- In order to reach the best result the neural network used a ResNet18 backbone and was treined using the ![kaggle Chest X-Ray pneumonia dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
- Using Gradcam to access in the understanding of highlighted points by the model.
